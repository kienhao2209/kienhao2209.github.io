#### Overview

In this step, you will create an **S3 bucket** to store invoice files uploaded by users. This bucket will be created in the **us-east-1** region, and you will also configure an **event notification** to trigger a **Lambda function** whenever a new file is uploaded into a specific folder.

---

#### Step 1: Access S3 Console

1. Log in to the [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/), search for **S3**, then select **S3** from the results.

ðŸ’¡ **Note:** Before creating the bucket, make sure you have selected the correct region **us-east-1** in the upper right corner of the AWS Console screen.  
Creating the S3 bucket in the correct region is crucial for services like Lambda or Textract to work seamlessly.
